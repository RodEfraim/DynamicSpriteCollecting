# DynamicSpriteCollecting
Game in which the player (blue) collects good sprites (green), but must avoid bad sprites (red) to finish with the highest score possible. The player's score can be tracked by the blue output string on the top left corner. 

The player is controlled by the left, right, up, and down keys. The player is also limited from going off the screen. There are sound effects for every collision. The game is completed once the player collects all the green sprites. Once the game is complete you have the option to play again by just clicking on the game screen. For every new game, the positions of the green and red sprites are always randomized.
